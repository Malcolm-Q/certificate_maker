My friend has to fill out a ton of PDF forms. It's the perfect job for Python so I put this together for him.

You need:
* A CSV with a column called "NAMES"
* A PDF template with a field called "Name" and a field called "Granted on"
* The current date

That's it.

Files are saved as: {name}_{suffix}.pdf
